### Breaking Changes
- Module structure has been fully changed.
  + Any imports that look like `from labrea.<module> import <object>` will need to be updated
- Changes to dataset
  + To overload a dataset, you now *must* provide a `dispatch=` argument to the decorator
    - Previously, a default dispatch of `Option('LABREA.IMPLEMENTATIONS.pkg.module.dataset_name')` was used
    - Similarly, a dispatch argument is required for the `@interface` decorator
  + `@my_dataset.overload` now takes `alias=` as either an alias or a list of aliases
    - Previously, `aliases=` was used for a list of aliases
  + `where=` argument is now renamed `defaults=` for clarity
  + `@dataset` no longer accepts an `alias=` argument
  + `callbacks=` has been renamed to `effects=`
    - Now takes functions of a single argument, or `Evaluatable` objects that return such functions
    - Can also subclass the `labrea.computation.Effect` class to define custom effects
- Changes to options
  + Previously, it was implicitly assumed that options must be a JSON-serializable dictionary
  + This is now enforced. Providing a non-serializable option will raise an error
    - e.g. a Pandas DataFrame cannot be provided as an option value
- Changes to pipelines
  + `LabreaPipeline.step` has been removed in favor of the `pipeline_step` decorator
    - Defining pipeline steps looks the same (like a dataset with empty first arg)
  + Composing pipeline steps is now done with the `+` operator rather than the `>>` operator
    - This is because `>>` is now used as an alias for the new `.apply` method on all `Evaluatable` objects
  + Pipelines can now be invoked in one of two ways
    - `pipeline(options)(value)`
    - `pipeline.transform(value, options)`
      + Here options can be omitted and an empty dictionary will be used
  + Pipelines now return the plain value, rather than the special `LabreaPipelineData` object
- Changes to Caching
  + Datasets are cached, but overloads do not have their own cache
    - This means that if you overload a dataset, it will be cached in the parent dataset's cache rather than in a separate cache
  + The `get`, `set`, and `exists` hooks in the `Cache` ABC have changed signatures
    - This only impacts those who were writing custom cache implementations
- `Evaluatable` is now an `ABC` rather than a `Protocol`
  + This only impacts those who are extending the labrea framework with custom types
- Implementing multiple interfaces at once is now done using the `@implements` decorator
  + Previously done with `@Interface.implementation(Interface1, Interface2, alias='ALIAS')`
  + `@implements(Interface1, Interface2, alias='ALIAS')`

### New Features
- All `Evaluatable` objects (`datasets`, `Options`, etc.) now have a `.explain()` method that returns a set of option keys that are required to evaluate the object
  - `Option('A').explain() == {'A'}`
  - Datasets will return every option key that is required to evaluate the dataset
- All `Evaluatable` objects can be called with no argument and an empty options dictionary will be inferred
- All `Evaluatable` objects now support the following methods for chaining transformations
  + `apply` (aliased as `>>`)
    + Used to apply a function to the result of an object
    + e.g. `my_dataset >> (lambda x: x + 1)`
  + `bind`
    + Used to apply a function to the result of an object and return a new labrea object based on the result
    + e.g. `my_dataset.bind(lambda x: my_dataset2 if x > 0 else my_dataset3)`
- Utility functions for some common operations for chaning together
  + `labrea.functions.map` recreates the `map` function for labrea objects
    + `my_list_dataset >> labrea.functions.map(lambda x: x + 1)`
  + `labrea.functions.filter` recreates the `filter` function for labrea objects
    + `my_list_dataset >> labrea.functions.filter(lambda x: x > 0)`
  + `labrea.functions.reduce` recreates the `reduce` function for labrea objects
    + `my_list_dataset >> labrea.functions.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y)`
- New `@pipeline_step` decorator for defining pipeline steps
  + Pipelines are now *evaluatable*, meaning they act like a dataset the returns a function of one variable
    - This means a pipeline can be provided as an argument to a dataset definition
- New case / when / otherwise syntax for defining conditional logic that can't be expressed with switches/overloads
  + `case(Option('A')).when(lambda a: a > 0, positive_dataset).otherwise(negative_dataset)`
- New `Map` type for mapping a dataset over multiple options values
  + `Map(Option('A'), {'A': [1, 2, 3]}).apply(list)()` == `[1, 2, 3]`
- New `WithOptions` type that can be used to provide pre-set options to an `Evaluatable` object
  + `my_dataset_a_1 = WithOptions(my_dataset, {'A': 1})`
- New `@implements` decorator for implementing multiple interfaces at once
  + `@implements(Interface1, Interface2, alias='ALIAS')`
- New `Cached` type that can cache any labrea object (not just datasets)
- New `Overloaded` type that can provide overloads for any labrea object (not just datasets)
- New `FunctionApplication`, `PartialApplication`, and `EvaluatableArguments` types that are the foundational building blocks for datasets and pipeline steps
- New effects system and corresponding `Computation` type that performs side-effects after an evaluation of a labrea object
- New `runtime` module used for handling managed effects

## Version 1.4.0
